>>The Gate of Babylon is the noble phantasm of the character Gilgamesh that was first introduced in the 2004 visual novel Fate/stay night. It is a key that opens a dimensional gate which leads towards Gilgamesh's personal treasury containing all of the legendary weapons known throughout history. Once activated, Gilgamesh can summon all of these weapons from his treasury and used them as projectiles to defeat his enemies.
